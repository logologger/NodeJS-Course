<h2>This part covers the NodeJS Course design for BackEnd Development and Desktop Application</h2>

<i>It is Assumed that person taking up this course having atleast medium knowledge of Javascript</i>

<i>Since NodeJS can be taken seperately because its a Web Development Course . so we will be covering working knowledge of MongoDB.How MongoDB fits well into Mean Stack Application. and why only MOngoDB here and why not MySQL</i>

<b>Day 1:</b><p>We will explore the server side of NodeJS.What is V8 Engine , history regarding NodeJS Application.We will discuss about the event driven programming in NodeJS, Asynchronous Programming and how it is useful in NodeJS.The single-threaded event-driven system is fast even when handling lots of requests at once, and also simple, compared to traditional multi-threaded Java or ROR frameworks.How NodeJS is used for creating Non-relational Database and why it is much powerful in creating some low intensive CPU application</p>


<b>Day 2:</b><p>We will cover installing NodeJS , Npm Modules and creating a server and giving the request and response to the browser. We will see some REST Client like PostMan that are helpful for NodeJS application. Although NodeJS can do many other operations but WE are restricting here to Full Stack Development.We will also how we can install various npm modules in our application and use them</p>

<b>Day 3</b>
<p>We will be covering Some Advance Javascript concepts before directly diving into NodeJS. We will cover here Anonymous function in Javascript.Callbacks in Javascript.Asynchronous Programming in Javascript.Data types and variables and scope of a variable in Javascript.Use of this keyword. What is JSON and how it has replaced the XML .Arrays, function expression will be covered. Now we will deal with ExpressJS (E in MEAN Stack).Why its a very important Node Modules and tremendous amount of features it provides in Web Development.</p>


<b>Day 4:</b>
<p>We will continue with ExpressJS here. How we can design RESTFUL api here . We will understand the application Architecture here and discuss and implement very simple routers , Controllers.We will be also be dealing with Custom Middleware here and how it can be used to intercept the incoming GET,POST  and other request and filter or modify them accordingly</p>


<b>Day 5:</b>
<p>We will discuss about Models in NodeJS and use of them in intergerating in MongoDB. Use of Schema in NodeJS , ..dealing with Mongoose package for MongoDB and what is BSON and how it is used in MongoDB .. We will be covering some theory regarding MongoDB , documents , collections and various query operations that we can perform here .. Mostly it will be MongoDB discussion here</p>

<b>Day 6:</b>
<p>Since We have nearly covered most of the concepts of NodeJS Plus mongoDB plus Express . We will now deal with design a Complete Full Stack Web Application in MEAN stack.
</p>

<b>Day 7:</b>
<p>We will integerating out Node Application with AngularJS .. and using the REST API calls and various PUT,DELETE,UPDATE and GET in them.We will deling with some form elements like uploading Image and storing it in MonogDB and then dealing with storing its path in MongoDB</p>

<b>Day 8:</b>
<p>We will be dealing with operations like validations check in MongoDB...Use of token and security package for login Application. We will dealing with reading files from Excel ..installing package and dealing with it ..We will be looking to using Asynchronous programming.. and Promises, Async await ..and other ways to deal with it.</p>

<b>Day 9:</b>
<p>We have touched nearly every stage of MEAN stack Web application. We will dealing with Debugging our application in NodeJS using Visual Studio Code.We will be dealing with Unit Testing in NodeJS using Mocha,Chai and other frameworks</p>

<b>Day 10:</b>
<p>We will be deploying our Application on Heroku and using github as a pipeline to see the changes. Our MongoDB will be deployed on MLabs...Thus we will be touching DevOps in NodeJS</p>


<b>Day 11:<i>(Optional if time permits)</i></b>
<p>We will be dealing with Docker container for Packaging our NodeJS Application and shipping it to various environments . We will discuss why it is used and what are the advantages it offers to us. Then we will be going with a Complete Example of using Docker</p>
